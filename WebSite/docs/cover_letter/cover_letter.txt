### Things I want in a job

		- I am not happy until everything is in its right place

	- Simple problems or tasks that can be automated or streamlined
		- i.e., We should never be hand entering data or solutions when scripts are available to perform these tasks
        - So we can focus on: 

    - Complex problems or tasks that require intelligent solutions
		- Utilize our minds where they are needed most, where technology is not the best solution

	- Recognition for creating intelligent solutions to those complex problems and taking leadership roles
		- If a person shows particular strengths, they should always be directed with those strengths in mind

    - Regularly require learning new methods and technologies for accomplishing tasks in a more efficient manner
		- We live in an age where technology is rapidly evolving and we need to be able to adapt with it and learn the best new ways to accomplish old tasks more efficiently
